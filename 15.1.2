 Difference between Data and Big data :
 
 Big Data >   Big Data is a concept in Software Engineering which we use when we have
 a large sets of machine generated data, which in most of the cases is unstructured and 
 not easy to use with traditional RDBMS concepts. 
 >Big data is a collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to 
 process using on-hand database management tools. The challenges include capture, curation, 
 storage, search, sharing, analysis, and visualisation. The trend to larger data sets is 
 due to the additional information derivable from analysis of a single large set of related
 data, as compared to separate smaller sets with the same total amount of data, allowing 
 correlations to be found to â€œspot business trends, determine quality of research, prevent 
 diseases, link legal citations, combat crime, and determine real-time roadway traffic conditions.
 
The four dimensions of Big Data:
Volume: Large volumes of data
Velocity: Quickly moving data
Variety: structured, unstructured, images, etc.
Veracity: Trust and integrity is a challenge


 Data > Data on the other hand is more of analyzing data which could be structured or
 unstructured. Even though they both sound similar, there have different objectives. 
 Out of huge data sets, when you want to narrow down a piece of customized data, we do number
 of steps in analyzing like investigating data, cleaning, transforming and getting the result.
